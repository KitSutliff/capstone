Project Overview - Kit Sutliff

Project Goals:

Prototype a tool that would allow a researcher to input a data set containing two lists and see, at a glance,       how many elements are shared across both list and how many are unique to each list.

One example of a use for a tool like this would be to input the lists of subscribers to two separate youtube       content creators.  The researcher would be able to quickly determine the extent to which their audience is shared   and which creator has the most unique users.


Description:

Users are able to input two lists.  The app will automatically generate a color coded bar chart compairing the    two lists by volume.  A user can click a button and the app will automatically filter all common elements out     of each list into a third list which is also color coded and animatied on the chart.

Tech Stack:

HTML    
CSS    
Javascript  
D3  
Flask   
Heroku  

Features:    
1) Users input a data set containing two lists. 
    The program analyzes the sources and outputs two lists:     
        - elements that are shared between the sources  
        - elements that are unique to each list

2) Visualization of elements shared across both lists versus those unique to each list.
