Project Overview - Kit Sutliff

**Project Goals:**

Prototype a tool that would allow a researcher to input a data set containing two lists and see, at a glance, how many elements are shared across both list and how many are unique to each list.

One example of a use for a tool like this would be to input the lists of subscribers to two separate youtube content creators. The researcher would be able to quickly determine the extent to which their audience is shared and which creator has the most unique users.

**Description:**

Users are able to input two lists. The app will automatically generate a color coded bar chart compairing the two lists by volume. A user can click a button and the app will automatically filter all common elements out of each list into a third list which is also color coded and animatied on the chart.

**Tech Stack:**

D3, JavaScript, CSS, HTML, React

**Features:**

Users input a data set containing two lists. The program analyzes the sources displays a graph that can animate:
- a chart with two bars, one for each list
- a chart with three bars, one for the items exclusive to each list and a third for the items shared by both

Color coded dynamic animated visualization of elements shared across both lists versus those unique to each list.

**Run App:**  
"npm start" in termial
